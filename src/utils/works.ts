      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Heading into the new year with the announcement of two upcoming albums, Skrillex’s team reached out to have us launch the artists’ server. With no existing official community, we got to work with building out exclusive member onboarding, top-end security measures as well as sleek channel, role, and embed designs to strengthen the user experience. 
        <br/><br/>
        During the initial launch, we welcomed tens of thousands of members with record-breaking levels of engagement (140,000+ messages sent in the first 24 hours)! To effectively capture these levels of activity, prior to the release, we had reached out to Skrillex’s biggest supporters to get a deeper understanding of what they would like to see within the community, allowing for the spread of fans across many channels in the server. Whether that be discussing teasers for the new albums in #general, showing off their talent in #producer-corner with hundreds of talented artists providing feedback, or even hanging out in the voice chats live streaming their favourite games and current beats they are working on! 
        <br/><br/>

      <h3>Speculation...</h3>
      <p>
        Creating tension and hype with upcoming releases is the best way to create a loyal fanbase. With Skrillex, we were blessed to get consistent teasers from his team leading up to the event. With these, we began an album rollout inside of the server leading to hundreds of thousands of messages.
        <br/><br/>
        This speculation was further capitalized on as it kept users on edge consistently, meaning that we could push users to post on their stories, promote Skrillex-related hashtags, and engage in community activations (listening parties, ticket giveaways, and more) through the massive interest the community had in the rollout.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/skrillex3.png" alt="">
      <h3>Opportunities for everyone...</h3>
      <p>
        Through online listening parties, we have changed the way new music releases are approached. Why stop at experiencing a new track by yourself, when you can live in the moment with thousands of other fans? With artists hopping in the chat and sharing the joy of releasing their newest track in real time, it’s clear that the connection with members provides an atmosphere like no other. 
        <br/><br/>
        Not only does this have a positive impact on Skrillex's fans, but provides a key marketing opportunity to increase the amount of engagement on the rest of his social platforms as there is an incentivized boost to continue the chatter during or after the initial release. Such examples include a whopping 200+ Instagram stories in under 10 minutes sourced from the server using the trending #QuestForFire hashtag to celebrate the announcement of his new album. 
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/skrillex4.png" alt="">
      <h3>A helping hand...</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst attending live shows can be a surreal experience, exploring new areas of the world can be challenging for a lot of people. 
        <br/><br/>
        By opening up a forum channel for members to take the initiative and converse about the shows they will be attending, we managed to provide benefits including supporting others in the signing-up process, organizing safe pre-show meetups, and even recommending nearby restaurants to dine in! 
        <br/><br/>
        This not only improves the experience for those getting involved but can act as a golden opportunity to find fellow fans to go with. A dedicated chat channel for certain events sparks high levels of interest and has resulted in many members finding themselves, just days in advance, purchasing a ticket for a once-in-a-lifetime experience after making plans with other members on the server! 
        <br/><br/>
        What makes this so simple is the ease of accessibility, each post has its own separate area in the server and acts as a space for members to hop in at any time to ask questions, also enabling Skrillex’s team to identify any issues and resolve them in real-time, preventing the delay and confusion other platforms tend to experience. As a result of such planning, there comes a gallery of unforgettable moments being posted all over the server, with many more to come as members continue to spread the joy and develop lifelong friendships, one show at a time. 
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/skrillex6.png" alt="">
      <br/><br/>
      <img src="/skrillex7.png" alt="">
      <h3>And much more...</h3>
      <p>
        Self-sustaining communities are key to keeping engagement consistent and with the passion spread in the EDM fanbase, everyone having a part to play makes it so special. With tons of events hosted on a regular basis involving server-held producer contests where over thirty talented producers are invited to prove their skills in live viewings, Skrillex-inspired art contests, or even album-themed baking showcases to show off members’ creativity, the possibilities are endless and we continue to work alongside the staff team to roll out new and innovative ideas. 
        <br/><br/>
        With 25,000+ members retained, 1,300,000+ messages sent and 110,000+ speaking minutes in voice chats all in the first year of launch, it’s clear the power of Skrillex’s community launched by Fragment Studios has played a key role in his branding.

      <h3>All Gas, No Breaks</h3>
      <p>
        Ski's team contacted us a week before his album release to set up their Discord community and handle the community management. The goal in this case was not only to build Discord engagement leading into the album launch, but have that hype carry over into a multi-month engagement plan. This was short notice, even for us, but we got to work immediately to make sure to make the most of his community.
        <br/><br/>
        Within 48 hours of their message, we had the server ready to launch with a full onboarding experience, a moderation team, and branding catered to his aesthetic. The launch went viral, bringing in over 20,000 members in the first 24 hours.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/ski2.png" alt="">
      <h3>Launch is Just The Beginning</h3>
      <p>
        While building out his community, we were tasked with building out an extensive activation plan to maximize chatter regarding his new album, 11th Dimension. We built a 1 month activation plan ranging from listening parties, to freestyle contests, and much more. This was all building off of Ski himself coming into the Discord and doing an AMA with his fans, which brought over 2 thousand live listeners.
        <br/><br/>
        From the second his team contacted us, we were in full sprint. The first month was jam packed with activations including an AMA with Ski himself, multiple listening parties, a streaming contest, and more. The Discord community was averaging over 20 thousand messages daily for months, keeping members engaged throughout the Album cycle. The community has now become a hub for all Ski Mask the Slump God superfans and has maintained activity for almost a year.

      <h3>Building Engagement with Exclusive Roles</h3>
      <p>
        Central to the project was a challenge: introduce an exclusive, highly coveted community tier that would inspire engagement without overwhelming participants. Our solution? ZENITH — an exclusive tier in the community offering exceptional benefits akin to a prestigious club membership.
        <br/><br/>
        However, the real innovation lay in how ZENITH was structured. Rather than presenting a single daunting milestone, we divided ZENITH into six distinct shards. Each shard represented a smaller, attainable goal that required members to complete specific tasks or challenges. By collecting all six shards, members could unlock the full ZENITH role.
        <br/><br/>
        This approach turned what could have been an intimidating grind into an engaging journey. Community members worked steadily toward their milestones, staying motivated and active while avoiding burnout. The shard system also encouraged collaboration and healthy competition, enhancing the overall experience.
        <br/><br/>
        ZENITH became more than just a role, it was a testament to O.XYZ's commitment to fostering a vibrant, participatory community and our dedication to creating innovative solutions that drive engagement.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/oxyz1.png" alt="">
      <h3>Clear Communication for a Global Audience</h3>
      <p>
        At Fragment Studios, we understand that effective communication is the cornerstone of a thriving global community. For O.XYZ’s Discord server, our team meticulously crafted and formatted all important announcements to ensure they were accessible, clear, and engaging for a diverse audience spanning the globe.
        <br/><br/>
        Every announcement was carefully written using precise language, avoiding jargon or complexity that might create barriers for non-native English speakers. We also employed clean and consistent formatting, making the messages easy to read and understand at a glance. This included the strategic use of headings, bullet points, and visual separators to highlight key information and guide readers through the content effortlessly.
        <br/><br/>
        By prioritizing clarity and inclusivity, we helped O.XYZ foster a welcoming environment where every community member, regardless of their background or location, felt informed and included. It was a meticulous process, but one that underscored the value of thoughtful communication in building a connected and engaged global community.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/oxyz2.png" alt="">
      <h3>Enhancing Engagement with Data and Planning</h3>
      <p>
        For O.XYZ, our team took a hands-on approach by gathering biweekly insights and statistical data from their Discord and Telegram communities. These reports provided valuable analytics for the O.XYZ team, enabling them to monitor activity trends, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions.
        <br/><br/>
        To complement this data-driven strategy, we introduced the Community Calendar. This weekly graphic, shared across Discord and other social platforms, highlighted all the key events happening throughout the week. From live discussions and updates to community challenges and upcoming partnerships, the calendar kept members informed and energized about what was ahead.
        <br/><br/>
        The Community Calendar quickly became a favorite among members, serving as a one-stop resource for staying connected and engaged. By combining actionable insights with practical planning tools, we helped O.XYZ cultivate a thriving and well-informed community.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/oxyz3.png" alt="">
      <h3>Bringing the Community Together with Creative Events</h3>
      <p>
        To foster a strong sense of connection within O.XYZ's vibrant community, Fragment Studios developed a variety of engaging event ideas designed to bring members closer together. From interactive discussions to collaborative activities, these events ensured that every community member felt valued and involved.
        <br/><br/>
        One of the highlights was hosting Ask Me Anything (AMA) sessions on Discord's virtual Stage feature. These sessions allowed O.XYZ leaders and community members to interact directly, with participants raising their hands to join the conversation, creating a dynamic and inclusive atmosphere.
        <br/><br/>
        We also introduced Game Nights and Trivia Contests, which added a touch of fun and friendly competition. Members could unwind, bond over shared interests, and celebrate victories together. Additionally, we launched a collaborative Spotify Community Playlist, where members contributed their favorite tracks to create a shared soundtrack that reflected the community's diverse tastes.
        <br/><br/>
        These events not only kept the community engaged but also strengthened the bonds between members, turning the O.XYZ Discord into a lively and welcoming space where connections could flourish.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/oxyz4.png" alt="">
      <p>Thus, by fostering collaboration, excitement, and connection, we empowered O.XYZ to cultivate a loyal and engaged community, setting the stage for long-term growth and success.</p>

    description: "Lazer has had a ton of buzz on socials recently, our job was to keep the views coming… 3 months and over 5 million organic views on social later, we've got the ball rolling.",
    content: `
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        Connecting with fans as an artist is of the utmost importance and for LAZER DIM 700s fans, the amount of unique talent they have is unmatched in the space. With too many barriers on other social media platforms, how could he effectively connect with and increase the strength of his fanbase? 
        <br/><br/>
        This is where Discord comes into play, and it’s all about how our team set up stages, hosted events and guided each and every one of them towards opportunities they never knew existed, and results for Lazer that he’s never seen before. 
      </p>
      <h3>Forming foundations</h3>
      <p>
        During the first few weeks of launch, from a few thousand members we managed to maintain over 10,000 messages sent & 1,500 speaking minutes on the server every day. With this came speculation and talk around Lazer’s newest album, new beats being live streamed produced in the & posted in channels for others to rate, as well game nights and friendly competitions being hosted on a daily basis.
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/lazer2.png" alt="">
      <br/><br/>
      <img src="/lazer4.png" alt="">
      <h3>Building on foundations - fostering results</h3>
      <p>
        It's important to understand your community and where their needs lie, which is why we took the opportunity to partner up with Molly Santana's Discord and throw the show of a lifetime. 
        <br/><br/>
        By simply finding out what both fanbases are talented at, we collaborated on a co-stream live on Twitch bringing in over 1,000 viewers at peak who were here to watch their fellow community members compete against each other for Lazer’s judgement. Whether it be rap battles, magic tricks or dances, everyone had a contribution to be made and it did not disappoint. 
        <br/><br/>
        The show organised within mere days of confirmation from the artist teams hosted over a dozen participants and showcased some of the funniest (and outrageous) performances, so much so that it resulted in fans took the initiative to post clips all over social media, generating 500,000+ views organically without any pushes from the artists, all within the first day of the stream going live. 
        <br/><br/>
      </p>
      <img src="/lazer5.png" alt="">
      <h3>The key takeaways?</h3>
      <p>
        Whilst we value the impact of numbers and engagement, we also see the importance in the connection between an artist and their fans. The stages, talent shows and exclusive drops in a dedicated space not only help increase the amount of potential listeners, but also shows the personal side of Lazer. For a fan to truly connect with the music an artist produces, it’s important to know who’s behind the voice and beats and this is evident with multiple members mentioning how they bought tickets to his KEEPIN IT CLOUDY tour as a result of this to get to see him first hand, truly showing the potential behind connecting with casual listeners. 
        <br/><br/>
        How can we turn your artists' listeners into dedicated fans? Community is at the heart of what we do, and it applies in every aspect of the music space.
